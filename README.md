# Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch-Linear_Regression_and_Image_Classification
A PyTorch deep dive, exploring regression on diabetes data and classification on MNIST/CIFAR-10, with neural network tuning for optimal results.

This Jupyter notebook encapsulates a comprehensive hands-on journey into deep learning using PyTorch, demonstrating the creation, training, and evaluation of models for both regression and classification tasks. Initially, the notebook delves into linear regression with the diabetes dataset from sklearn, implementing both simple and complex neural network architectures to predict diabetes progression. It further explores the effect of varying learning rates on model performance.

The adventure intensifies with image classification tasks using two benchmark datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10. The notebook begins with MNIST, leveraging a fully connected neural network to recognize handwritten digits, achieving over 95% accuracy through iterative architecture adjustments and hyperparameter tuning. Progressing to the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset, the notebook confronts the complexity of color image classification, highlighting the necessity for more sophisticated network designs to enhance predictive performance.

Key implementations within the notebook include:
Data loading and preprocessing with PyTorch's DataLoader for efficient batch processing.
Construction of neural network models using PyTorch's nn.Module, with ReLU activations and CrossEntropyLoss for classification tasks.
Training loops with forward and backward propagation, employing SGD optimization.
Analysis of model accuracy and loss metrics to iterate towards improved model architectures.
Visualization of training and testing results to provide intuitive insights into model behavior.
This notebook serves as an academic submission and a practical guide for students and enthusiasts venturing into the world of neural networks and deep learning, offering a rich learning experience with one of the most popular deep learning frameworks in the industry.
